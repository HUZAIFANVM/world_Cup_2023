## Exploring Bowling Stats of the ICC World Cup 2023 üìä

### Overview
This project delves into an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the bowling data from the 2023 Cricket World Cup. Using Python, particularly pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib, insightful trends were uncovered, and key metrics were visualized.

### Project Description
In this Python project, I performed an EDA on the bowling data from the ICC World Cup 2023. The analysis included:

### Key Metrics Explored:
- Top bowlers by overs bowled, wickets taken, and economy rates
- Teams' performance based on overs, runs conceded, and wickets
- Distributions of extras (wides, no-balls) by teams

### Insights Revealed:
The EDA unveiled intriguing insights into bowling performances, such as the highest wicket-takers, most economical spells, and batsman-friendly bowling attacks.

### Tools and Libraries Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

### Skills Demonstrated:
This project showcased my skills in data wrangling, analysis, and visualization using Python's powerful data science ecosystem. I'm excited to continue exploring sports analytics and extracting valuable insights from data.
